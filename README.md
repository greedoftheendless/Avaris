# Avaris, the Latin root of Greed!

Welcome! This repository contains my personal Nix OS configuration using Niri(Main) and Hyprland, designed for a clean and efficient workspace.

Initially crafted with a **Catppuccin theme**, I've since refined it to a more **cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic**. The goal was a setup that's **clean, attractive, and minimalistic**, perfect for a daily driver without unnecessary animations or distractions.

If you find this useful, please consider **starring the repository**!

Have an idea for a tweak or an improvement? Feel free to **submit a pull request**.
Enjoy your Nixified OS!

> Need to make a keybind one for hyprpanel though I'm not active on hyprland so much. Will make it if possible

### 🛠 Installation

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: This setup is intended for **NixOS**. Due to the declarative nature of Nix, following these steps will give you an exact copy of my system.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greedoftheendless/Hyprland-files

2. Prepare the dotfiles

Place the contents of the cloned repository into a folder of your choice (e.g., ~/dotfiles).
3. Things to remember before running the implementation command

Make sure that the duplicate Nix folder in /etc/nixos is deleted.
To make this operation work smoothly, make sure to symlink all the folders in dotfiles/.config to ~/.config, and symlink the folder dotfiles/nixos to /etc/nixos.
That way, any future configuration changes will apply cleanly.
4. Rebuild your system

Rebuild your system using the following command to apply the configuration.

sudo nixos-rebuild switch

📚 Notes & Integrations

    Wallpapers: Managed by Waypaper, utilizing swww and mpvpaper as the engine.

    Notifications: Handled by Sway Notifications Control (Swaync).

    Audio: Managed through pavucontrol and wpctl.

    Lock Screen: Uses Hyprlock with a music player widget (currently under development; includes shutdown, lock, sleep options, and custom theming).

    Auto-Start: Configured in $HOME/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf under the exec lines and in the configuration file of ~/.config/niri.

    Scratchpads (for Hyprland): Configured for quick access to terminals, music, and notes.

    NVIDIA Drivers: Installed with the latest NVIDIA and AMD drivers. Adjust configuration accordingly.

    Waybar: Highly modular, supporting various modules for battery, Wi-Fi, media players, and more.

    Rofi/Vicinae: Rofi offers application search, SSH connections, and terminal/file selection. Vicinae provides similar features plus more — see Vicinae Docs

📝 To-Do List

    Create a Bash script to automate the installation process for non-NixOS users.

    Transition all .config setups to Nix modules for easier management.

Stay hungry, stay foolish. Keep customizing!
